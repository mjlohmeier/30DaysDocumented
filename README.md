# 30DaysDocumented

This is going to be Wes Bos's JavaScript30 with my own comments.

My strategy for completing this challenge is to use a critical reading method called SQ3R. SQ3R stands for Skim, Question, and then three R's: Read, Recite, Review. Watching Wes's videos is the Skim. I will be looking closely at what he's doing and paying close attention to what I don't understand, then quickly going over the basic layout of the code. Immediately afterwards (or as quickly as possible), I then Question and think about what I'm curious to learn. After that, I Read the entire body of finished code, skipping over the things that repeat without adding to my understanding, but still making sure that I am thinking about every piece of functionality in the program. After that, I Recite, adding comments that serve as points of interest, action items for my later use, and basic description of the program.

Review can be absurdly extensive or as brief as necessary.

I'm looking for partners to teach and learn with as I go through this project so please make a pull request if you'd like to make a contribution. 

P.S. these projects will invole use of rubber chickens (no real chickens harmed in the development process)
