# 30DaysDocumented

This is going to be Wes Bos's JavaScript30 with my own comments.

My strategy for completing this challenge is to use a critical reading method called SQ3R. SQ3R stands for Skim, Question, and then three R's: Read, Recite, Review. Watching Wes's videos is the skim. I will be looking closely at what he's doing and paying close attention to what I don't understand. Immediately afterwards (or as quickly as possible), I then write down some questions. After that, I Read the entire body of finished code, skipping over the things that repeat without adding to my understanding, but still making sure that I am thinking about every piece of functionality in the program. After that, I Recite, adding comments that serve as points of interest, action items for my later use, and basic description of the program. 

I'm looking for partners to teach and learn with as I go through this project so please make a pull request if you'd like to make a contribution. 

P.S. these projects will invole use of rubber chickens (no real chickens harmed in the development process)
